It uses a non-neural network example, which I believe is a gentler introduction. You will hear me refer to this technique as \"vanilla\" gradient descent. \n",
    "    - Stochastic Gradient Descent, Clearly Explained!!! by StatQuest w/ Josh Starmer. This builds on the techniques in the previous video.  This technique is the one that is actually implemented inside modern 'nets. \n",

    "The paradox of the derivative by 3Blue1Brown. Does a great job explaining a derivative. \n",
    "    - Visualizing the chain rule and product rule by 3Blue1Brown. Explains the black magic that happens within Stochastic Gradient Descent. \n",
